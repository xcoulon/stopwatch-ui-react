= Stopwatch UI React

This is the front-end part of the application that allows for recording laps during run&bike events

== Requirements

- npm

== How to run it

The process to run the backend is pretty rudimentary for now. It could probably be improved in the future.

```
$ npm start

```


will start the front-end and open the browser to http://localhost:3000/ which should immediately connect to the server running on http://localhost:8080/
